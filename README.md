Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) is a design pattern that separates the read and write operations of a system, and the Mediator pattern is often used to implement communication between different components in a decoupled way. Here's a simple example of implementing CQRS using the Mediator pattern in Java.

Here is a short explanation:

1. Command: Represents a write operation.

2. Query: Represents a read operation.

3. CommandHandler: Handles a specific type of command.

4. QueryHandler: Handles a specific type of query.

5. Mediator: Manages the communication between commands and handlers.
